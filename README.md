# Shopping Cart

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the integration of Strapi API and React application to create a shopping cart. I demonstrated how to add and remove products from the app. I further refined it to include a functionality to restock the products as they decrease in quantity. This project gave me an opportunity to integrate my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills using Visual Studio Code knowledge with the use of other application programming interfaces (APIs).
